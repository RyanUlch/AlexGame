Alex__Img4__"Lavelle missed their spouse, and tried to get them back."	Alex__Img4__"You got scared at something you didn't understand, and wanted to care for the people you love"	Alex__Img4__"Neither of you are evil. You haven't done anything yet"	Alex__Img4__"Well you punched them out... but excluding that... You haven't done anything."	Alex__Img4__"It's ok, let's figure this all out together"	Alex__Img4__"Just give me the knife. It'll be ok"

	Hmm... this is strange.....	You died, but it doesn't seem like the earthly world is done with you yet.	I wonder why?																																	
		Keep it brief																																		
			Oh, a bit busy are you? Fine.	Go figure out how you died and prevent it if you can.	Good Luck.

		I don't know either...																																		
			I may be a demi-god, but I've never seen a case quite like this.	...	I am going to have to send you back, but I can't just put you back into your body.	In order to re-inhabit your body, you will need to first prevent your initial death.	That's not going to be easy. Despite your cultures myths about ghosts; spirits like you have very little ability to interact with the real world.	The best arrow in your quiver is the ability to slightly influence others emotions, as well as hear what they are thinking in the moment.	Another issue is that your corporeal memories don't transfer with you in spirit form, you'll have to piece it together yourself.	One more thing and this is important.	When you go back, you will be put in the world the morning the day you died.	If you reach the end of the day and didn't prevent your death, you will reset the day along with everything you've changed.	Feel free to experiment and make wrong choices if you'd like to see what happens.	You can always reset to the beginning of the day again.	Open the time menu anywhere to advance time.																					
				Thank you, oh mighty one																																
					Good Luck.

				This is really weird speech for a demi-god...																																
					I mean, you need to learn how to play the game right? Figured clear speech was the best approach.																															
						Ok, thank you for the information																														
						Game? I'm dead, I'm not playing chess.																														
							Oh my.  My speech is not for you Alex.	Do not worry, you will be ok and figure this all out.	I believe in you!
