- improve user input
  - only track "pressed, still pressed, released"
- add a walk loop
  - while movement buttons are held, trigger a move action each interval
- support multi-message prompts with auto-continue
  - implement via multiple prompt messages on the same row in cells to the right
  - loop through those rows, generating prompts for each with a "continue" choice, then the final one has the actual choices from the next row
