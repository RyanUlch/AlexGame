Hello,

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is meant specifically for the 2023 GameDev.js Game Jam, and as such is primarily worked on by just our team:  
[Ryan Ulch](https://github.com/RyanUlch)  
[Eric Sartor](https://github.com/EricSartor)  

That being said; If you have noticed a bug, or want to suggest a feature - Create an issue and indicate that you would like to work on it.
Ryan and Eric will use their descretion on whether the change can be implimented by a third party. Any successful PRs done this way will grant you credit within the README and the final games credits.

Thank you ❤️
